              In pursuance with its motto, KN BAKSHI COLLEGE OF EDUCATION has
              been established by KARMATAND FOUNDATION to provide high quality
              teacher education with latest teaching methods, techniques and
              infrastructure. A team of highly qualiÔ¨Åed professionals,
              educationists, bureaucrats, philanthropists and social activists
              have worked hard to give their vision a shape so that it becomes a
              model for others to follow in the field of setting up high
              standards of institutions through tireless activism. We today need
              high quality infrastructure in remote areas of the country so that
              decentralisation and balanced development is achieved across the
              nation. This can only be done by taking up projects which are in
              consonance with the needs of balanced growth so that our people
              living in the interiors of the country are not deprived of their
              right to avail equal opportunity and high quality facilities. We
              believe that this kind of efforts will go a long way in empowering
              our people through education and knowledge which may liberate them
              from all kinds of bondage in real sense.
