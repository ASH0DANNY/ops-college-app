              The end-product of education should be a free creative man, who
              can battle against historical circumstances and adversities of

            <p>
              lndian civilization and culture has highest regards for teachers.
              Since time immemorial education is held as highest virtue and
              teachers are respected in the society. Dr. Radhakrishnan believed
              that “teachers should be the best minds in the country”. In
              context of our rich civilizational heritage and in pursuance of
              the need to produce high quality teachers, KN Bakshi College of
              Education has been circumstances and Swami Vivekanand has said,
              “Education is the manifestation of perfection already inman”. The
              role of the teacher is to facilitate that manifestation. It is an
              art as well as science. The modern education needs to be
              facilitated through teachers who are well versed in their craft so
              as to secure the future of coming generations. It is a task of
              great responsibility as the future of the nation is dependent upon
              it. The aim of the College is to train and prepare high quality
              teachers who can educate the coming generation with high academic
              standard and equip them with required skills and education. The
              college seeks to produce high quality teachers who can mould the
              coming generation into world class citizens leading the humanity
              towards its highest achievements and glory.
